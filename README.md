# Spatial interfaces for productivity applications in AR and VR

Most attempts at building productivity applications in AR/VR have consisted of mapping traditional 2D interfaces into 3D space. They use the same interface patterns and conventions that are used in traditional desktop application design, not all of which are appropriate in a 3D setting. In this project we explore interface patterns for navigating information spaces and interacting with interface elements that take advantage of the unique capabilities and challanges of a 3D environment.
