\title{Spatial VR: Navigating large data sets in virtual reality}\maketitle
You could also focus on a single interaction technique, \eg for scrolling, zooming, rearranging, \dots

\section{Abstract}

\textbf{What is the state of the world?}\\
We need to navigate large data sets every day. Text, node-link diagrams, images, \dots

\textbf{What is the problem?}\\
Linear scrolling is the typical solution. Can be time-consuming and cumbersome.

\textbf{What are current solutions?}\\
Mid-air full-body gestures (\eg work by Underkoffler), not good for productive work (Gorilla arm syndrome).
Others? What about ZUIs?

\textbf{Why are they not sufficient for solving the problem?}\\
Data is always presented on a 2D surface (\ie display). Not very efficient for data with more dimensions.

\textbf{What is your solution?}\\
VR?

\textbf{Some more detailed description of the solution.}\\
How does it work?

\textbf{Why is this solution better? How do you show this?}\\
Evaluation?
